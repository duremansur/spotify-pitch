        <h1>Hey Spotify!</h1>
        <p>I'm <span class="highlight">Dure Mansur</span>, a product manager who builds experiences that bring people together.</p>
        <p>Here's why I want to join your product team in Toronto.</p>

    <!-- Slide 2: Personal Connection -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Music Is My Language of Connection</h2>
        <p>Growing up, evenings at home meant my father's collection of Indian classics filling the house. Kishore Kumar's voice would echo through the rooms, and somehow these melodies became our family's shared vocabulary.</p>
        
        <p>Later, my sisters and I discovered a different kind of musical bonding. We'd take turns controlling our Alexa, each playing songs from our playlists. During car rides, we'd create these spontaneous listening sessions where everyone contributed one track. <span class="highlight">These moments taught me that music isn't just entertainment, it's how we share pieces of ourselves</span>.</p>
        
        <p>As a product manager, I've always been drawn to building things that create these kinds of connections. Every feature needs to serve a human need, every workflow should feel natural, and every user interaction should add value to someone's day.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>At Bank Alfalah, I spent time deeply immersed in product challenges that genuinely excited me. Rolling out QR payments across 25,000 terminals meant solving complex technical problems while keeping the user experience simple. Launching the donation feature integrated with NGO partnerships and building discount management systems required balancing multiple stakeholder needs. Building dashboards wasn't just about displaying data, it was about telling stories that helped teams make better decisions.</p>

        <h2>A Product Idea Close to My Heart</h2>
        <p>Those music sharing moments with my family inspired something I've been thinking about. What if Spotify could create that same magic of musical discovery and connection for everyone?</p>

    <!-- Slide 6: Why Me -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Why I Belong at Spotify</h2>
        
        <h3>üéØ I Build Products People Actually Use</h3>
        <p>At Bank Alfalah, I obsessed over user workflows and interface design. I redesigned payment terminals to reduce transaction errors and spent months perfecting QR payment flows. Every feature launch was measured by user adoption and satisfaction, not just technical completion.</p>
        
        <h3>üß† I Connect Systems and Stories</h3>
        <p>My background spans product strategy, user experience, and data analytics. I can read the numbers that show user behavior, but I also understand the human motivations behind those patterns. This helps me design features that serve real needs, not just theoretical use cases.</p>
        
        <h3>üå± I'm Committed to Growth</h3>
        <p>Currently pursuing Google UX Design and Business Intelligence certifications to deepen my skills in design thinking and data analysis. I believe the best product managers stay curious and keep evolving with new tools and methodologies.</p>
        
        <h3>‚ù§Ô∏è I Lead Through Collaboration</h3>
        <p>I believe great products come from great teams. My leadership style focuses on creating space for others to excel, asking thoughtful questions, and building consensus around shared goals. The best ideas can come from anywhere.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 7: My Vision -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>What We Could Build Together</h2>
        <p>I envision Spotify's internal tools feeling as intuitive and delightful as the consumer app itself.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Data platforms that tell compelling stories</span>, helping product teams understand user behavior and make confident decisions.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Development workflows that enhance creativity</span> rather than constrain it, making it easier for teams to ship features that users genuinely love.</p>
        
        <p>Most importantly, a product culture where every decision starts with empathy for the millions of people who rely on Spotify for the soundtrack to their lives.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 8: Call to Action -->
    <div class="slide">
        <h2>Let's Create Something Meaningful Together</h2>
        <p>I'm looking for more than just my next role. I want to be part of a team that's building the future of how people discover and share music.</p>
        
        <p>Spotify represents something powerful to me. It's where my father's classical Indian music can coexist with my sister's indie discoveries. <span class="highlight">It's proof that technology can preserve cultural connections while creating new ones</span>.</p>
        
        <p>I want to help you build products that strengthen these connections, tools that empower your teams, and experiences that make music even more central to how people relate to each other.</p>
